# HoloEditor

A voxel art editor for volumetric displays that use cylindrical coordinates.


###Features

* Paint still images using a circular or cylindrical brush.
* Two panels, radial and longitudinal, provide "slice" views to edit a shared 3D canvas.
* Drag the red carets to control the slice views.
* Use the symmetry features to draw complex shapes quickly.
* Save and load ".hol" files with gzip compression.
* Connect a volumetric display via network to get canvas update events.
